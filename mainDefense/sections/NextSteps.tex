% Some obvious next steps would be the experimental measurement of
% the optimum parameters we found and of the effect of the kinetic inductance.
%
% Another good direction would be to try and obtain analytical expressions for
% the contrast with a kinetic inductance. This would allow us to gain a deeper
% knowledge, in the same vein as the optimization of the non-kinetic circuit.
%
% Finally, an interesting idea to explore and formalize (credit to my supervisor for it,
% Fernando Gonzalez Zalba) is to design the kinetic inductance in such a way that,
% for the On state, the super conductance would brake, turning the inductor into a
% resistance (ideally high enough to not create a short circuit).
% Modifying the script used to generate figure \ref{fig:IdealContrast}
% to plot this case, all tunings converge to the \(\LOff\), but with an
% optimum \(C_{c}\) arbitrarily large for all cases. This case needs to be
% studied with more care and more formally, since it appears to be the definitive
% solution.
%
% To end this thesis, I would like to thank my supervisor Fernando Gonzalez Zalba
% for all the guidance and help he gave me, and to my family and significant
% other for all the love and support.
