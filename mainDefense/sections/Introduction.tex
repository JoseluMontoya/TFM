% % Silicon-based quantum computing is a quantum computing paradigm that uses
% % trapped electrons in silicon quantum dots to build the qubits. The 3 main
% % qubit architectures using QD are\cite{burkardSemiconductorSpinQubits2023}:
% \begin{frame}{Types of spin qubits}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Loss-DiVincenzo qubits}
%         % Thought up by Loss and DiVincenzo%\cite{lossQuantumComputationQuantum1998}
%         % in their original paper, it defines the qubits as the spins of the
%         % trapped electrons themselves, and for their control uses a combination
%         % of an external magnetic field and the control of tunnel barriers
%         % between the QD.
%     \item \textbf{Singlet-triplet qubits}
%         % Proposed by Levy,%\cite{levyUniversalQuantumComputation2002}
%         % instead
%         % of using single spins, it uses as basis the singlet and triplet state
%         % of a pair of spins. The main benefit with respect to the Loss-DiVincenzo
%         % is that the qubit lives in a decoherence-free subspace with respect
%         % to global magnetic fields that couple to the spin of the electron.
%     \item \textbf{Exchange-only qubits}
%         % Created by DiVincenzo \textit{et al.}%\cite{divincenzoUniversalQuantumComputation2000},
%         % it uses
%         % the spin of 3 QD to create a qubit fully controllable using voltages
%         % through the tunnel barriers that separate them.

% The main advantage of silicon-based quantum computing is scalability, since
% it can leverage the decades in advancements of the CMOS industry. The objective
% with silicon-based quantum computing is then to build a quantum computer with
% an enormous amount of high fidelity qubits, instead of a quantum computer
% with a great amount of extremely high fidelity qubits, and to use the bigger
% number of qubits to run error correction algorithms. For this to be implemented,
% we need high fidelity and high speed readout techniques. At the moment there are
% multiple measuring schemes showing promising results\cite{gonzalez-zalbaScalingSiliconbasedQuantum2021}, such as RF reflectometry
% of a SET. In this master's thesis, we will explore the use of a kinetic inductor
% in this measuring scheme with the objective of improving the performance.
