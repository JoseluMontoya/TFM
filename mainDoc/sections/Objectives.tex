As said in the previous section, the aim of this thesis is to explore the use
of a kinetic inductor to improve the measurements on silicon spin qubits. The
steps to take for this will be:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Learn the basics of: how a SET functions, RF reflectometry
        and kinetic inductance non-linearity.
    \item Analyze a conventional measuring circuit to obtain expressions for
        the parameters and the contrast with an optimum configuration.
    \item Explore the viability of using a kinetic inductor to improve the
        measuring performance of the previous circuit via numerical
        simulations.
\end{enumerate}
